<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [HELLO-MICROVERSE] <a name="about-project"></a>

**[HELLO_MICROVERSE]** is my first Microverse Project. In this project, we will set up a "Hello world" repository. No complex coding is required for this exercise. Your goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices you learned about in previous steps. we will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in your future job as well, so it is important to know them! You will also get your first code review. This is also a process that will be used in all Microverse projects.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

Remember to document your work in a professional way.
Create a new GitHub repo.
Create a new branch according to the GitHub flow rules.
Add a .gitignore file.
Add node_modules to gitignore file.
Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
Add descriptive README file to your project - please use this template but remember to customize it to your project.
Add 3 files (each one in a separate commit):
A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". Use h1 tag for that.
A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header (make it in your favorite color).
A test.md file with the text "This file should be ignored by git".
Make sure that the last file is actually ignored by git and is not present in your GitHub repository.
Open a pull request.

<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

> Add at least 2 questions new developers would ask when they decide to use your project.

- **Q: How do I change the color of the header?**

  - A: To change the color of the header, you can modify the CSS code in the `style.css` file. Look for the class selector for the header element and update the `color` property to the desired color value.

- **Q: Can I add additional sections to the webpage?**

  - Yes, you can add additional sections to the webpage by creating new HTML elements and styling them using CSS. Refer to the existing code structure as a guide and make sure to properly link the new sections in the navigation if needed.
